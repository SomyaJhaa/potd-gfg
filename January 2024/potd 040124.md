# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The given code aims to find the element that occurs only once in an array where every other element occurs thrice. The bitwise operations are used to track the count of set bits for each bit position in a number.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Initialize three variables tn, tnp1, and tnp2 to track the count of bits at each position in a number.
- - tn: Tracks the bits where count is not divisible by 3.
- - tnp1: Tracks the bits where count is divisible by 3.
- - tnp2: Tracks the bits where count is divisible by 3 twice.
- Iterate through the array, updating the counts for each bit position using bitwise operations:

- - cwtn: Count where the bit is set in the current array element arr[i] and tn.
- - cwtnp1: Count where the bit is set in the current array element arr[i] and tnp1.
- - cwtnp2: Count where the bit is set in the current array element arr[i] and tnp2.
- Update the counts based on the bitwise operations:
- - Update tn and tnp1 based on cwtn.
- - Update tnp1 and tnp2 based on cwtnp1.
- - Update tn and tnp2 based on cwtnp2.
- The final result is stored in tnp1, which represents the bits where the count is not divisible by 3.
- Convert the final result to an integer using static_cast<int>(tnp1) and return it.


# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$O(n)$$
$$n$$ : length of given array
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity : $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    int singleElement(int arr[], int N) {
        long long tn = LLONG_MAX, tnp1 = 0, tnp2 = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            long long cwtn = arr[i] & tn;
            long long cwtnp1 = arr[i] & tnp1;
            long long cwtnp2 = arr[i] & tnp2;

            tn = tn & (~cwtn);
            tnp1 = tnp1 | cwtn;

            tnp1 = tnp1 & (~cwtnp1);
            tnp2 = tnp2 | cwtnp1;

            tnp2 = tnp2 & (~cwtnp2);
            tn = tn | cwtnp2;
        }
        return static_cast<int>(tnp1);  // Convert back to int
    }
};
