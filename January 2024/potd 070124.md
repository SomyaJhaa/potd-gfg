## [Split Array Largest Sum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/split-array-largest-sum--141634/1)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem involves finding the minimum maximum sum achievable by splitting an array into K subarrays. To approach this, we can use binary search to find the minimum maximum sum. The idea is to use binary search on the range of possible maximum sums and check whether it's possible to split the array into K subarrays such that the maximum sum is less than or equal to the current candidate maximum sum.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Approach:

- Calculate the total sum of the array (totalSum) and find the maximum element (mx).
- Set the initial range for binary search as [mx, totalSum], as the maximum possible sum lies between the maximum element and the total sum.
- Perform binary search within this range.
- In each iteration of binary search, calculate the mid value and check if it's possible to split the array into K subarrays such that the maximum sum is less than or equal to the mid value. 
- If yes, update the answer and move the high pointer to mid-1 to explore lower values. If not, move the low pointer to mid+1 to explore higher values.
Return the final answer.


# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$O(N*log(sum(arr)))$$
$$n$$ : length of given array
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity : $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code

#include <climits>

class Solution {
public:
    int splitArray(int arr[], int N, int K) {
        int totalSum = 0, mx = INT_MIN;

        // Calculate total sum and find maximum element
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            totalSum += arr[i];
            mx = max(mx, arr[i]);
        }

        int lo = mx, hi = totalSum, ans = INT_MAX;

        // Binary search on the range [mx, totalSum]
        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;

            // Check if it's possible to split array into K subarrays
            // such that the maximum sum is less than or equal to mid
            if (isValid(arr, mid, K, N)) {
                ans = min(ans, mid);
                hi = mid - 1; // To minimize the answer
            } else {
                lo = mid + 1; // To get a valid range
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }

    // Check if the requiredSum is possible to get by splitting array into
    // k or fewer than k subarrays
    bool isValid(int arr[], int requiredSum, int k, int n) {
        int sum = 0, count = 1;

        // Iterate through the array to check the validity
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (sum + arr[i] <= requiredSum) {
                sum += arr[i];
            } else {
                sum = arr[i];
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count <= k;
    }
};
