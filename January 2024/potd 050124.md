# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem requires finding the total number of ways to construct buildings on both sides of a road, ensuring that no two buildings are adjacent to each other. The buildings on opposite sides of the road cannot be adjacent.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Initialize four variables prev, prev_, curr, and curr_ to 1. These variables represent the count of ways to construct buildings at different positions.
- Iterate from 1 to N (exclusive).
- In each iteration, update curr as the sum of prev and prev_ (representing the count of ways to construct buildings at the current position).
- Update curr_ as the value of prev (updating the variable representing the count of ways for the previous position).
- Update prev with the value of curr and prev_ with the value of curr_ for the next iteration.
- After the loop, calculate the answer by adding curr and curr_ and taking the modulo mod.
- Calculate the final result by squaring the answer and taking the modulo mod.
- Return the final result.


# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$O(n)$$
$$n$$ : length of given array
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity : $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution{
	public:
	int TotalWays(int N)
	{
	    int mod = 1000000007;
	    int prev = 1, prev_ = 1, curr = 1, curr_ = 1;
	    
	    for(int i = 1; i < N; i += 1) {
	        curr = (prev + prev_) % mod;
	        curr_ = prev;
	        prev = curr;
	        prev_ = curr_;
	    }
	    
	    long long ans = (curr + curr_) % mod;
	    ans = (1LL * ans * ans) % mod;
	    
	    return ans;
	}
};
