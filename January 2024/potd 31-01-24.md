## [Insert and Search in a Trie](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/trie-insert-and-search0651/1)

**Intuition:**
The given code is implementing the Trie data structure, which is a tree-like structure used for efficient retrieval of a set of strings. The `insert` function inserts a string into the Trie, while the `search` function checks if a given string is present in the Trie.

**Approach:**
1. In the `insert` function, the code traverses the Trie based on the characters of the input string. If a character is not found in the current node's children, a new TrieNode is created and linked as a child to the current node. This process continues until all characters of the string are inserted, and the last node is marked as a leaf.

2. In the `search` function, the code traverses the Trie in a similar manner as in the insert function. If at any point a character is not found in the current node's children, the function returns false, indicating that the string is not present. If the traversal reaches the end of the string and the last node is marked as a leaf, the function returns true, indicating that the string is present.

**Time Complexity:**
Let N be the number of strings in the list, M be the sum of the lengths of all strings, and |key| be the length of the search key.
- The `insert` function iterates over each character of each string in the list, taking O(M) time.
- The `search` function iterates over each character of the search key, taking O(|key|) time.
Therefore, the expected time complexity is O(M + |key|).

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is determined by the number of Trie nodes created during the insertion process. In the worst case, all characters of all strings are unique, leading to the creation of M Trie nodes.
- The Trie nodes require O(M) space.
Therefore, the expected auxiliary space complexity is O(M).



## Code 
```
class Solution
{
    public:
        //Function to insert string into TRIE.
        void insert(struct TrieNode *root, string key)
        {
            for(auto i : key){
                if(root -> children[i - 'a']){
                    root = root -> children[i - 'a'];
                }
                else{
                    TrieNode * new_node = getNode();
                    root -> children[i - 'a'] = new_node;
                    root = new_node;
                }
            }

            root -> isLeaf = 1;
        }

        //Function to use TRIE data structure and search the given string.
        bool search(struct TrieNode *root, string key) 
        {
            for(auto i : key){
                if(root -> children[i - 'a']){
                    root = root -> children[i - 'a'];
                }
                else{
                    return 0;
                }
            }

            return root -> isLeaf;
        }
};
```
