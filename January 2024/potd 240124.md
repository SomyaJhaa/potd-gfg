## Check if a given graph is tree or not

## Intuition

The goal is to determine whether a given graph is a tree. A tree in graph theory is a connected acyclic graph, and to validate this, I checked for connected components and the absence of cycles.

## Approach

##### Built Graph :
   - Created an adjacency list to represent the graph using an array of ArrayLists. Populate the adjacency list based on the provided edges.

##### Connected Components :
   - Used Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the graph and mark connected components.
   - Maintained an array to keep track of visited nodes during BFS.
   - Counted the number of connected components in the graph.

##### Checked for Multiple Components :
   - If the number of connected components is greater than 1, the graph is not a tree (as a tree should be a single connected component).

##### Checked for Cycles :
   - Used BFS to detect cycles in the graph.
   - Maintained an array to keep track of visited nodes during cycle detection.
   - If a visited node is encountered, checked if it is the parent of the current node. If not, a cycle exists.

##### Final Decision :
   - If the graph has multiple connected components or contains a cycle, it is not a tree. Returned false in such cases.
   - If no issues are found, the graph is a tree. Returned true.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(N + M)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->
$N$ : number of nodes

$M$ : number of edges

- Space complexity : $O(N)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
