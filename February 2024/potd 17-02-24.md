## [Does array represent Heap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/does-array-represent-heap4345/1)

**Intuition:**
This problem aimed to check whether a given array forms a max heap or not. A max heap is a binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.

## Approach

**Iterated Through the Array :**
- My function iterated through the array up to the second last level of the heap (index `(n - 1) / 2`).
- Each iteration checked whether the current node is greater than or equal to its left and right children.

**Checked Max Heap Property :**
- For each node at index `i`, calculated the indices of its left and right children (`2 * i + 1` and `2 * i + 2`).
- Checked if the left child is within the array bounds and greater than the current node OR if the right child is within the array bounds and greater than the current node.

**Returned the Result :**
- If any of the conditions in the check step are true, it means the array doesn't satisfy the max heap property, and my function returned `false`.
- If the loop completed without returning false, the array satisfies the max heap property, and my function returned `true`.

My approach efficiently checked the max heap property by examining each node and its children, ensuring that the array represents a valid max heap structure.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(n)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->

  - $n$ : given size of array
  - My loop iterated through the array up to the second last level of the heap 
$((nâˆ’1)/2)$ ~ $O(n)$

- Space complexity : $O(1)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code 

```
//User function Template for Java
class Solution {
    
    // Function to check if the given array forms a max heap
    public boolean countSub(long arr[], long n) {
        
        // Iterating through the array up to the second last level of the heap
        for (int i = 0; i <= (n - 1) / 2; i++) {
            int leftChild = 2 * i + 1;
            int rightChild = 2 * i + 2;

            // Checking if the left child is within the array bounds and greater than the current node
            // OR if the right child is within the array bounds and greater than the current node
            
            if ((leftChild < n && arr[i] < arr[leftChild]) || (rightChild < n && arr[i] < arr[rightChild])) {
                // If any condition is true, the array doesn't satisfy the max heap property, returning false
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        // If the loop completes without returning false, the array satisfies the max heap property, returning true
        return true;
    }
}
```
