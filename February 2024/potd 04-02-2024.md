## Subtraction in Linked List

## Intuition

This problem involves converting a binary number represented by a linked list into its decimal equivalent. The linked list represents a binary number, where the significance of the bits decreases with increasing index in the linked list. The goal is to calculate the decimal value of this binary representation.

## Approach

**Removed the Leading Zeros :** Removed leading zeros from both linked lists.

**Size Comparison :** Compared the sizes of the linked lists to determine the larger and smaller numbers. If the sizes are equal, compared each digit to identify the larger number.

**Reversed the Linked Lists :** Reversed both linked lists to simplify the subtraction process.

**Performed Subtraction :** Iterated through the reversed linked lists and subtractd the corresponding digits. Handled borrowing if necessary.

**Removed Leading Zeros from Result :** After subtraction, removed the leading zeros from the result.

**Returned the Result :** The final result represented the subtraction of the smaller number from the larger one.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(n + m)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->

n and m are the lengths of the linked lists representing the two numbers.

- Space complexity : $O(n + m)$ 
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code 
It may appears lengthy but I have knowingly created helper functions for better understanding.
```
/*

Definition for singly Link List Node
class Node
{
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        next = null;
    }
}

You can also use the following for printing the link list.
Node.printList(Node node);
