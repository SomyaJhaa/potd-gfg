## [Play With OR](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/play-with-or5515/1)

## Intuition:
The provided code is written in C and appears to implement the given task of modifying an array in-place by performing the bitwise OR operation on consecutive elements.

## Approach:
The code iterates through the array and performs a bitwise OR operation on each element with its adjacent element. This operation is done in-place, meaning that the original array is modified directly.

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the provided code is O(n), where n is the size of the array. This is because the code iterates through the array once, performing a constant-time operation in each iteration.

## Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as the modification is done in-place, and no additional space is used that scales with the input size.

Overall, the code efficiently solves the problem with a linear time complexity and constant space complexity.



## Code 

```
int* game_with_number(int arr[], int n)
{
    
    // Complete the function
    for(int i=0; i<n-1;i++){
        arr[i]=arr[i]|arr[i+1];
        
    }
    return arr;
    
}
    
```
