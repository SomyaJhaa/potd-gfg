## [Check if a number is divisible by 8](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-if-a-number-is-divisible-by-83957/1)

## Intuition

The problem requires checking whether a given decimal number, represented as a string, is divisible by 8 or not. The divisibility by 8 depends on the last three digits of the number.

## Approach

1. **Extract Last Three Digits:**
   - Extract the last three digits of the given number using string manipulation.

2. **Check Divisibility:**
   - Convert the extracted three digits to an integer.
   - Check if the integer is divisible by 8.

3. **Return Result:**
   - If divisible, return 1; otherwise, return -1.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the code is O(1), as the processing involves only a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size. Extracting the last three digits and performing the modulus operation are constant-time operations.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is also O(1). The code uses a constant amount of space to store the integer `t` representing the last three digits. The space required does not scale with the input size.




## Code 

```
class Solution{
    public:
    int DivisibleByEight(string s){
        int t=(s[s.length()-3]-'0')*100+(s[s.length()-2]-'0')*10+(s[s.length()-1]-'0');
        if(t%8!=0) return -1;
        return 1;
    }
};
    
```
