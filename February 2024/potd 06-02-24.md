## [Count the nodes at distance K from leaf](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/node-at-distance/1)


## Intuition

This problem involves counting the nodes at a given distance (`k`) from leaf nodes in a binary tree. To achieve this, I employed a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal to explore the tree, keeping track of the current path and identifying leaf nodes at the specified distance.

## Approach

 **DFS Traversal :**
   - Utilized a recursive DFS traversal for exploring the binary tree.
   - Maintained a current path list to record encountered nodes during traversal.

**Checked Leaf Nodes :**
   - Upon reaching a leaf node, examined if the distance from the leaf node to the current node is equal to the given distance (`k`).
   - If the condition is satisfied, incorporated the node at the appropriate position in the current path to a HashSet, ensuring uniqueness.

**Returned the Count :**
   - Upon completing the traversal, returned the count of unique nodes stored in the HashSet as the final result.

My approach ensured comprehensive exploration of the tree while preserving the current path. At each leaf node, the distance condition is checked, and the HashSet is updated accordingly. The HashSet is used to store unique nodes at the desired distance, and its size provides the count of such nodes. The recursive DFS ensures a thorough examination of the entire tree.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(N)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->

$N$ : number of nodes in the binary tree.

- Space complexity : $O(H + N)$ 
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$H$ : height of the tree.

## Code 

```
//User function Template for Java

// class Node  
// { 
//     int data; 
//     Node left, right; 
   
//     public Node(int d)  
//     { 
//         data = d; 
//         left = right = null; 
//     } 
// }

class Solution
{
    private static HashSet<Node> jawab;
    private static ArrayList<Node> currentPath;

    // Function to return count of nodes at a given distance from leaf nodes.
    int printKDistantfromLeaf(Node root, int k){
        // Initializing the HashSet and ArrayList
        jawab = new HashSet<>();
        currentPath = new ArrayList<>();

        // Helper function for DFS traversal
        dfsHelper(root, k);

        // Returning the count of unique nodes at distance k from leaf nodes
        return jawab.size();
    }

    // Helper function for DFS traversal
    private static void dfsHelper(Node root, int k){
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }

        // Adding the current node to the path list
        currentPath.add(root);

        // Checking if the current node is a leaf node and satisfies the distance condition
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null && currentPath.size() > k) {
            jawab.add(currentPath.get(currentPath.size() - 1 - k));
        }

        // Recursive calls for left and right subtrees
        dfsHelper(root.left, k);
        dfsHelper(root.right, k);

        // Removing the last node from the path list
        currentPath.remove(currentPath.size() - 1);
    }
}
```
