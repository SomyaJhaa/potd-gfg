## [Pairs violating the BST property](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/pairs-violating-bst-property--212515/1)

**Intuition:**
The problem asks to find the number of pairs violating the properties of a Binary Search Tree (BST). To solve this, we can perform an in-order traversal of the BST to obtain a sorted array of its elements. Then, we count the number of inversions in this sorted array, which corresponds to the number of pairs violating the BST property.

**Approach:**
1. Perform an in-order traversal of the BST to obtain a sorted array of its elements.
2. Use a merge sort algorithm to count the number of inversions in the sorted array.
3. During the merge step of the merge sort, count the inversions by comparing elements of the two halves.
4. Whenever an element from the left half is greater than an element from the right half, increment the count by the number of elements remaining in the left half, as they all will form inversions with the current element.
5. Sort the elements while merging the two halves.
6. Return the count of inversions as the result.

**Time Complexity:**
Let \( n \) be the number of nodes in the BST. In the worst case, both the in-order traversal and merge sort take \( O(n \log n) \) time. Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is \( O(n \log n) \).

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the BST. This space is used to store the sorted array obtained from the in-order traversal of the BST. Additionally, there is recursion involved in the merge sort algorithm, which contributes to the stack space, but since the maximum depth of recursion is \( O(\log n) \) in the average case, the overall space complexity is still \( O(n) \).


## Code

```
class Solution {
  public:

    /*You are required to complete below function */
    void merge(vector<int>& arr, int low, int mid, int high, int& count) {
        int i = low, j = mid + 1;

        while (i <= mid && j <= high) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
                // If element at index i is greater than element at index j,
                // then all elements from i to mid will violate the BST property with element at index j
                count += (mid - i + 1);
                j++;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }

        // Sort the elements while merging
        sort(arr.begin() + low, arr.begin() + high + 1);
    }

    void mergeSortAndCount(vector<int>& arr, int low, int high, int& count) {
        if (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            mergeSortAndCount(arr, low, mid, count);
            mergeSortAndCount(arr, mid + 1, high, count);
            merge(arr, low, mid, high, count);
        }
    }

    int pairsViolatingBST(int n, Node *root) {
        vector<int> inorder;
        inOrderTraversal(root, inorder);

        int count = 0;
        mergeSortAndCount(inorder, 0, inorder.size() - 1, count);
        
        return count;
    }

private:
    void inOrderTraversal(Node* root, vector<int>& inorder) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return;
        
        inOrderTraversal(root->left, inorder);
        inorder.push_back(root->data);
        inOrderTraversal(root->right, inorder);
    }
};

```
