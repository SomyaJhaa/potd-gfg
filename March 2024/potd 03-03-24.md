## Largest Number formed from an Array

**Intuition:**

The goal is to arrange the given array of strings in a way that, when concatenated, they form the largest possible number. To achieve this, we need a custom comparison function for sorting the strings.

**Approach:**

1. Define a custom comparison function (`mycomp`) that takes two strings, `a` and `b`, and compares their concatenations (`a + b` and `b + a`).
2. Sort the array of strings using the custom comparison function. The sorting should be in descending order to place larger values first.
3. Concatenate the sorted strings to form the largest number.

**Time Complexity:**

The most time-consuming operation is the sorting step, which has a time complexity of O(n * log(n)), where n is the number of strings in the array.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity is O(n) due to the auxiliary space used to store the array of strings. The sorting operation usually doesn't require additional space, as it's often done in-place.


## Code

```
class Solution{
public:
	// The main function that returns the arrangement with the largest value as
	// string.
	// The function accepts a vector of strings
	static bool mycomp(string a,string b){
	    string t1=a+b;
	    string t2=b+a;
	    return t1>t2;
	}
	string printLargest(int n, vector<string> &arr) {
	    // code here
	    sort(arr.begin(),arr.end(),mycomp);
	    string ans="";
	    for(auto it:arr){
	        ans+=it;
	    }
	    return ans;
	}
};

```
