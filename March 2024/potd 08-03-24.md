## Check if frequencies can be equal

## Intuition
The goal is to determine if it's possible to rearrange the characters in a given string such that they all have the same frequency or if they already have the same frequency.
I think it will involve checking the initial frequencies and attempting a rearrangement if needed.

## Approach

**Checked Initial Frequency :**
   - The `sbSame` function iterates through the character frequencies in the given string.
   - It ensured that there is only one distinct frequency, indicating whether all characters have the same initial frequency.

**Attempt Rearrangement :**
   - If the initial frequencies are the same, the string already satisfies the condition, and the function returns true.
   - If the initial frequencies differ, attempt to make them equal by decrementing the frequency of each character one by one.
   - After each decrement, checked if all frequencies become the same.
   - If at any point all frequencies become the same, the function returned true.

**Final Result :**
   - If neither the initial frequencies nor any rearrangement satisfies the condition, the function returned false.

My approach efficiently checked whether the string can have the same frequency for all characters by either having them initially equal or making them equal through a single decrement for at most one character.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O( n )$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->
$n$ : length of the input string `s`
- Space complexity : $O( 26 )$ ${\equiv}$ $O( 1 )$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code

```
//  User function Template for Java

class Solution {
    
    
    // Array to store the frequency of each character
    static int[] kitnibaar;
    
    // Main method to check if the string has the same frequency for all characters
    boolean sameFreq(String s) {
        
        // Initializing the frequency array
        kitnibaar = new int[26];
 
        // Updating the frequency array based on the characters in the string
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            kitnibaar[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        // Checking if all frequencies are initially the same
        if (sbSame()) {
            return true;
        }
 
        // Trying decrementing each character's frequency and checking if all frequencies become the same
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (kitnibaar[i] > 0) {
                kitnibaar[i]--;
                if (sbSame()) {
                    return true;
                }
                kitnibaar[i]++;
            }
        }
 
        // If no such rearrangement is possible, returning false
        return false;
    }
    
    // Method to check if all frequencies are the same
    static boolean sbSame() {
        int ekjaisa = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (kitnibaar[i] > 0) {
                ekjaisa = kitnibaar[i];
                for (int j = i + 1; j < 26; j++) {
                    if (kitnibaar[j] > 0 && kitnibaar[j] != ekjaisa) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
}
