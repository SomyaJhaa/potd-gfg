## Swap the array elements

## Intuition
The goal of the code is to swap every pair of elements in the given array. 

## Approach

- My approach involved iterating through the array and swapping each element with the one located two positions ahead.

**I iterated through the array :**
   - Used a loop to iterate through the given array.

**Swapped elements in pairs :**
   - For each iteration, swapped the current element with the element located two positions ahead in the array.
   - The swapping is performed using a temporary variable to ensure the values are exchanged correctly.

**Repeated until the second-to-last pair:**
   - Iterated until the second-to-last pair to avoid accessing an index that is out of bounds.

I assumed the array length is sufficient for pair-wise swapping and does not handle odd-length arrays.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O( n )$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->
$n$ : length of the array
- Space complexity : $O( 1 )$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code

```
// User function Template for Java

class Solution{
    
    // Function to swap every pair of elements in an array
    public void swapElements(int[] arr, int n){
        
        // Iterating through the array, swapping elements in pairs
        for( int i = 0; i < arr.length - 2; i++){
            
            // Temporary variable to store the current element
            int t = arr[i];
            
            // Swapping the current element with the element two positions ahead
            arr[i] = arr[i+2];
            
            // Assigning the temporary variable value to the element two positions ahead
            arr[i+2] = t;
        }
    }
}
```
