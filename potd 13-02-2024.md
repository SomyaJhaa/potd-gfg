## [Clone an Undirected Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/clone-graph/1)

**Intuition:**
The goal is to clone an undirected graph where each node contains a value and a list of neighboring nodes. The approach involves using a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the original graph and create a clone of each node and its neighbors.

**Approach:**
1. The `cloneGraph` function takes a node as input and recursively clones the graph using DFS.
2. The base case checks if the current node is NULL, in which case it returns NULL.
3. If the node is not present in the `mp` (unordered map), it creates a new node in the clone graph with the same value and an empty list of neighbors.
4. It then iterates through the neighbors of the current node and recursively calls `cloneGraph` for each neighbor. The cloned neighbors are added to the list of neighbors for the current node in the cloned graph.
5. The function returns the reference to the cloned node.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity is expected to be O(n + m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges in the graph. This is because, in the worst case, every node and edge need to be visited once.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is expected to be O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the graph. This is due to the usage of the unordered map `mp` to store the mapping between original nodes and their corresponding clones during the DFS traversal. The recursion stack contributes to the auxiliary space complexity.


## Code 

```
class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<Node*, Node*>mp;

    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
        if(node==NULL) return NULL;
        if(mp.find(node)==mp.end()){
            mp[node]= new Node(node->val, {});
            for(auto it:node->neighbors){
                mp[node]->neighbors.push_back(cloneGraph(it));
            }
        }
        
        return mp[node]; 
    }
};
    
```
